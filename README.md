# AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS) MQTT Service

This `acs-mqtt` service satisfies the MQTT component of the Factory+ framework and contains the code to build and run the HiveMQ MQTT server for Factory+. It includes a build of an [authentication plugin](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/hivemq-krb) for HiveMQ that supports the Factory+ authentication framework.

> **Note**
> The [AMRC Connectivity Stack](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack) is an open-source implementation of the AMRC's [Factory+ Framework](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk). For more information about the MQTT component of Factory+ see the [MQTT specification](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk) or for an example of how to deploy this service see the [ACS repository](https://github.com/AMRC-FactoryPlus/amrc-connectivity-stack).
